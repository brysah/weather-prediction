# Weather Prediction 

This is a simple weather application built with React. It provides weather information for Brazilian capitals and allows users to search for the current weather in any city.
This project is my solution to the [1STi Front End Challenge](https://github.com/1STi/desafio-frontend).

## Features

-   **Weather Forecast**: Get the current weather forecast for Brazilian capitals.
-   **Search**: Search for the current weather in any city.
-   **Detailed Information**: View detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory `cd weather-prediction`.
3.  Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4.  Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5.  Access the application in your web browser .
 
## Project Additions

-   SCSS
-   Axios
-  React-router-dom
-  React-icons 
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
  
 ## Limitations

Please note that it was not possible to add the forecast for the next 5 days due to the discontinuation of the Yahoo Weather API. Instead, I have utilized the OpenWeather API for weather data.
